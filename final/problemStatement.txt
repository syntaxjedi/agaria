The purpose of this program was to test my javascript skills and start making
the basic functions of my game. This template will be built on in the future
and will eventually become a fully function game.

What it will do:
1. ask the user for their "warrior" name
2. show the user a list of weapons they can choose from to defeat various
   enemies, these weapons will have all the stats displayed below them
3. show the user a list of enemies they can fight, upon choosing an enemy the
   program will:
4. begin running a test fight using the selected weapon, the program will
   calculate the weapon damage, any extra hits, any critical hits, and the
   enemy's damage, it will then decrement the health accordingly, once the user
   or the enemy is out of health, the program will stop and:
5. display the final health of both user and enemy, and the total damage the
   user did against the enemy.
